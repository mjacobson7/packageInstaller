# Package Installer Exercise

## Description

You suddenly have a curious aspiration to create a package installer that can handle dependencies. You want to be able to give the installer a
list of packages with dependencies, and have it install the packages in order such that an install won’t fail due to a missing dependency.
This exercise is to write the code that will determine the order of install.

## Requirements

* Please complete the exercise in either C#, Javascript, Java or Scala.
* Please use Test Driven Development (TDD) and include your tests.
* Please submit your code in a git repo (zipped and emailed, not on github) where you have committed throughout the process so that
* we can see your progress as you code the solution.
* The function should accept an array of strings defining packages and their dependencies. Each string contains the name of a package
* followed by a colon and space then any dependencies required by that package. For simplicity we’ll assume that a package can have
* at most one dependency.
* The function should reject as invalid a dependency specification that contains cycles.
* The function should output a comma separated string of package names in the order of install, such that a package’s dependency will
* always precede that package.

##Examples

**VALID INPUT EXAMPLE 1**

The input:

```bash
[ "KittenService: CamelCaser", "CamelCaser: " ]
```
represents two packages, KittenService and CamelCaser, where KittenService depends on CamelCaser. In this case the output should be:
```bash
"CamelCaser, KittenService"
```
The output indicates that CamelCaser needs to be installed before KittenService.
